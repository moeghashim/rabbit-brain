2026-01-18 - Decided to model learning tracks as user-owned records with trackConcepts join table; UI will suggest tracks per concept from analysis and allow explicit Learn from author CTA with rejection feedback.
2026-01-18 - Added tracks + trackConcepts tables and created Convex tracks module (createTrack, listTracks) to store user learning tracks derived from concept suggestions.
2026-01-18 - Added UI affordances for learning tracks, concept rejection feedback, and explicit Learn from author CTA; introduced Tracks page and nav entry.
2026-01-18 - Fixed track list typing by returning concept IDs as Id<"concepts"> and filtering nulls before response.
2026-01-18 - Cleaned lint errors: typed follow sets in posts feed logic and switched layout/header nav links to Next Link components.
2026-01-18 - Fixed duplicate React key issue by keying suggestion cards on suggestionId instead of conceptId.
2026-01-18 - Filtered LLM/naive concepts against expanded stopwords and removed filler-only names; repurposed concept follow action to start tracks instead of feeding the follow list.
2026-01-18 - Replaced X API import with agent-browser capture (text + screenshot), stored screenshots in Convex storage, and surfaced images across analysis, feed, and recent posts.
2026-01-18 - Added agent-browser skill with a capture script to open URLs, extract text, and screenshot pages.
2026-01-18 - Fixed feed type to include screenshotUrl on returned post objects.
2026-01-18 - Added fallback screenshot capture for cached X URL imports so older cached posts still get images.
2026-01-18 - Added explicit agent-browser binary lookup + ENOENT guidance for local/CI installs via AGENT_BROWSER_PATH or global npm install.
2026-01-18 - Added Cloudflare capture worker (Playwright Browser Rendering) and switched importPost to call CAPTURE_SERVICE_URL for text + screenshot base64, storing the image in Convex storage.
2026-01-18 - Added deployment README for the Cloudflare capture worker with setup + Convex env vars.
2026-01-19 - Deployed Cloudflare capture worker, set CAPTURE_TOKEN secret, and configured Convex CAPTURE_SERVICE_URL/TOKEN for dev.
